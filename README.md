# Vue 3 + Nuxt 3 + Pinia + Vuetify Boilerplate

Welcome to my Vue 3 + Nuxt 3 Boilerplate! This starter project is designed to provide a solid foundation for any new Vue application, combining modern tools and best practices for a powerful, scalable, and efficient development setup.

## 🚀 Project Features

- **Vue 3** - The latest version of Vue, providing a reactive and component-based architecture.
- **Nuxt 3** - Server-side rendering, file-based routing, and other great features to build optimized, performant web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and flexible UI development.
- **Axios** - A promise-based HTTP client, perfect for making requests to APIs.
- **Vuetify** - A Vue UI Library with beautifully crafted material components.

## 📂 Project Structure
